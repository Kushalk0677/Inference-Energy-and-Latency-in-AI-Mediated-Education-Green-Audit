### Solution:

The domain of a function is the complete set of possible values of the independent variable, which in most cases is 'x'. In simpler terms, it's the set of all possible inputs for the function. The range, on the other hand, is the complete set of all possible resulting values of the dependent variable (usually 'y'), after we have substituted the domain.


For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. The domain of this function is all real numbers because you can square any real number. So, the domain is (-∞, ∞). The range, however, is only the non-negative real numbers because squaring any real number cannot result in a negative number. Therefore, the range is [0, ∞).

To calculate the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon, you can use the following formula:

Interior Angle = [(n - 2) × 180°] / n

Where:
- n is the number of sides in the polygon
- 180° represents the sum of angles in a triangle

For example, if you have a regular hexagon (6 sides), the calculation would be:

Interior Angle = [(6 - 2) × 180°] / 6
Interior Angle = [4 × 180°] / 6
Interior Angle = 720",16.5519,649.0744,39.21,,

Circumference of a Circle

The circumference of a circle is the distance around the edge of the circle. It is like the perimeter of a polygon, but for a curved shape. The circumference of a circle depends on its diameter, which is the distance across the circle through the center. The diameter is twice the radius, which is the distance from the center to the edge of the circle.

The circumference of a circle is related to the diameter and a special number called pi, which is approximately 3.14. Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of any circle, no matter how big or small. This means that if we divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter, we always get the same value, which is pi. We can write this as a formula:

Circumference = pi x diameter

or

C = pi x d

We can also use the radius instead",17.2766,671.2882,38.86,,

# Answer
The area of a triangle can be calculated using various methods depending on the information available. Here are some common methods:

1. **Base and Height Method**:
   The area (A) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
   where the base is the length of one side of the triangle, and the height is the perpendicular distance from that side to the opposite vertex.

2. **Heron's Formula**:
   If you know the lengths of all three sides of the triangle (a, b, and c), you can use Heron's formula:
   First, calculate the semi-perimeter (s):
   \[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]

### Answer:
A transversal is a line that intersects two or more other lines at distinct points. When a transversal crosses parallel lines, several angle relationships are created:


1. Corresponding Angles: Angles that are in the same relative position at each intersection where the transversal crosses a parallel line. These angles are congruent.

2. Alternate Interior Angles: Angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines. These angles are congruent.

3. Alternate Exterior Angles: Angles that are on opposite sides of the transversal and outside the parallel lines. These angles are congruent.

Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry, is a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic equations to represent geometric shapes and figures on a coordinate plane. It allows for the precise calculation of distances, slopes, and areas of shapes, as well as the determination of the relationships between different geometric entities.

To prove that a quadrilateral is a rectangle using coordinate geometry, you can follow these steps:

42,FP16,Mathematics,What is the unit circle and why is it important in trigonometry?,"The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 unit, centered at the origin (0,0) of a coordinate plane. It is a fundamental concept in trigonometry because it provides a geometric interpretation of the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent. The unit circle allows us to define these functions in terms of the coordinates of points on the circle.

For any angle θ (measured in radians), the point (x, y) on the unit circle that corresponds to that angle has coordinates (cos(θ), sin(θ)). This means that the cosine of an angle is equal to the x-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle, and the sine of an angle is equal to the y-coordinate of that point.

43,FP16,Mathematics,Explain what it means for two angles to be complementary and how their trig functions relate.,"

Two angles are complementary if they add up to 90 degrees. For example, 30 degrees and 60 degrees are complementary angles.

The trig functions of complementary angles have a special relationship called the cofunction identity. This means that the trig function of one angle is equal to the cofunction of the other angle. The cofunction of an angle is the angle that has the same trig function value but with a different sign and a different function. For example, the cofunction of sine is cosine, and the cofunction of cosine is sine.

The cofunction identity for complementary angles is:

sin(A) = cos(90 - A)

cos(A) = sin(90 - A)

tan(A) = cot(90 - A)

cot(A) = tan(90 - A)

44,FP16,Mathematics,How do you use the law of sines to find a missing side or angle in a triangle?,"The law of sines states that in any triangle, the ratio of the length of a side to the sine of the opposite angle is constant. That is, for a triangle ABC, we have:

a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides opposite to the angles A, B, and C respectively.

To use the law of sines to find a missing side or angle in a triangle, we need to know at least one side and its opposite angle, and either another side and its opposite angle, or another angle. Then, we can set up a proportion using the law of sines and solve for the unknown quantity.

For example, suppose we have a triangle ABC with the following measurements:

The law of cosines is a formula that relates the lengths of the sides and the cosine of the angle opposite to one of the sides of any triangle. It can be written as:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C)

The law of cosines can be used to find the length of a side or the measure of an angle when you know the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them, or when you know the lengths of all three sides and want to find the angles. The law of sines, on the other hand, relates the lengths of the sides and the sines of the angles opposite to them. It can be written as:

Radian measure is a way of measuring angles based on the ratio of the arc length to the radius of a circle. One radian is the angle that subtends an arc length equal to the radius of the circle. A full circle has 2π radians, or 360 degrees.

To convert between degrees and radians, we can use the following formulas:

- Degrees to radians: radians = degrees * (π / 180)
- Radians to degrees: degrees = radians * (180 / π)

For example, to convert 45 degrees to radians, we multiply by π / 180:

radians = 45 * (π / 180) = π / 4

### Answer:
The Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 is a fundamental relation in trigonometry that arises from the Pythagorean theorem applied to a right-angled triangle.


To derive this identity, consider a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse of length 1 (unit circle), and let θ be one of the non-right angles. The side opposite to θ will have length sinθ, and the adjacent side will have length cosθ. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.


Therefore, we have:

The inverse sine function, or arcsin, takes a ratio as input and gives the angle as output.

Arcsin(0.5) means the angle whose sine is 0.5. To find this angle, we can use the unit circle, which is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. The unit circle shows the coordinates of points on the circle as (cos(theta), sin(theta)), where theta is the angle measured from the positive x-axis in the counterclockwise direction.
