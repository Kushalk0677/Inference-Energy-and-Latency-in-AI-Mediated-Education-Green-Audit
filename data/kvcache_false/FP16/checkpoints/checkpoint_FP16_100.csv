### Solution:

The domain of a function is the complete set of possible values of the independent variable, which in most cases is 'x'. In simpler terms, it's the set of all possible inputs for the function. The range, on the other hand, is the complete set of all possible resulting values of the dependent variable (usually 'y'), after we have substituted the domain.


For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. The domain of this function is all real numbers because you can square any real number. So, the domain is (-∞, ∞). The range, however, is only the non-negative real numbers because squaring any real number cannot result in a negative number. Therefore, the range is [0, ∞).

To calculate the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon, you can use the following formula:

Interior Angle = [(n - 2) × 180°] / n

Where:
- n is the number of sides in the polygon
- 180° represents the sum of angles in a triangle

For example, if you have a regular hexagon (6 sides), the calculation would be:

Interior Angle = [(6 - 2) × 180°] / 6
Interior Angle = [4 × 180°] / 6
Interior Angle = 720",16.5519,649.0744,39.21,,

Circumference of a Circle

The circumference of a circle is the distance around the edge of the circle. It is like the perimeter of a polygon, but for a curved shape. The circumference of a circle depends on its diameter, which is the distance across the circle through the center. The diameter is twice the radius, which is the distance from the center to the edge of the circle.

The circumference of a circle is related to the diameter and a special number called pi, which is approximately 3.14. Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of any circle, no matter how big or small. This means that if we divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter, we always get the same value, which is pi. We can write this as a formula:

Circumference = pi x diameter

To derive this identity, consider a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse of length 1 (unit circle), and let θ be one of the non-right angles. The side opposite to θ will have length sinθ, and the adjacent side will have length cosθ. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

68,FP16,Mathematics,Explain what continuity of a function means and give an example of a discontinuous function.,"


### Answer:Continuity of a function at a point means that the function is defined at that point, the limit of the function as it approaches that point exists, and the limit equals the function's value at that point. A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval.


An example of a discontinuous function is the step function, defined as:


f(x) = {

  1 for x >= 0,

  0 for x < 0

}


This function has a jump discontinuity at x = 0 because the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 from the left does not equal the limit as x approaches 0 from the right, nor does it equal f(0).

70,FP16,Mathematics,How does integration relate to the area under a curve?,"

# Answer
Integration in calculus is a fundamental concept that relates to the area under a curve. When you integrate a function over a certain interval, you are essentially calculating the total area bounded by the curve of the function, the x-axis, and the vertical lines corresponding to the endpoints of the interval.

For a continuous function f(x) defined on an interval [a, b], the definite integral of f(x) from a to b is given by:

\[ \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \]

This integral represents the net area between the function f(x) and the x-axis from x = a to x = b. If the function is above the x-axis, the area is positive, and if the function is below the x-axis, the area is negative. The definite integral takes into account the direction of the area, so it can be thought of as the signed",16.0799,634.0416,39.43,,

**Solution 1:**

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers ""wrap around"" after they reach a certain value—the modulus. To understand this concept, consider a clock face. A standard clock has 12 hours, and when the hour hand moves from 12 to 1, it has completed one full cycle. If we think of the clock as a modular system with a modulus of 12, then the hour hand at 12 is equivalent to 0, at 1 is equivalent to 1, at 13 is equivalent to 1 (since 13 mod 12 is 1), and so on.


In modular arithmetic, we say that two numbers are congruent modulo a number n if they have the same remainder when divided by n. For example, 17 and 5 are congruent modulo 12",16.5845,647.8954,39.07,,

### Answer:
A vector is a mathematical entity that has both magnitude and direction, and it is typically represented by an arrow. The length of the arrow indicates the magnitude of the vector, while the direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the vector. Vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, force, and displacement.

Scalars, on the other hand, are quantities that have only magnitude and no direction. Examples of scalar quantities include mass, temperature, and speed. Scalars are represented by a numerical value and a unit, but they do not have a direction associated with them.

In summary, the main difference between vectors and scalars is that vectors have both magnitude and direction, while scalars have only magnitude. Vectors are represented by arrows, while scalars are represented by numerical values and units.

### Answer:An asymptote is a line that a graph of a function approaches but never actually reaches. This concept is often encountered in the study of functions in calculus and precalculus. Asymptotes can be vertical, horizontal, or slanted (oblique).


Vertical asymptotes occur when the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as the input approaches a certain value. This typically happens when there is a division by zero in the function's formula. For example, the function f(x) = 1/(x-2) has a vertical asymptote at x = 2 because as x approaches 2, the function's value grows without bound.


Horizontal asymptotes are approached by the function as the input either goes to positive or negative infinity. They represent a value that the function gets closer and closer to but never actually reaches. For instance, the function f(x) = 3x + 1 has a horizontal",16.9815,664.5406,39.13,,
