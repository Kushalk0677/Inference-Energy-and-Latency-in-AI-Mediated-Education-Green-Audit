### Solution:

The domain of a function is the complete set of possible values of the independent variable, which in most cases is 'x'. In simpler terms, it's the set of all possible inputs for the function. The range, on the other hand, is the complete set of all possible resulting values of the dependent variable (usually 'y'), after we have substituted the domain.


For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. The domain of this function is all real numbers because you can square any real number. So, the domain is (-∞, ∞). The range, however, is only the non-negative real numbers because squaring any real number cannot result in a negative number. Therefore, the range is [0, ∞).

To calculate the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon, you can use the following formula:

Interior Angle = [(n - 2) × 180°] / n

Where:
- n is the number of sides in the polygon
- 180° represents the sum of angles in a triangle

For example, if you have a regular hexagon (6 sides), the calculation would be:

Interior Angle = [(6 - 2) × 180°] / 6
Interior Angle = [4 × 180°] / 6
Interior Angle = 720",16.5519,649.0744,39.21,,

Circumference of a Circle

The circumference of a circle is the distance around the edge of the circle. It is like the perimeter of a polygon, but for a curved shape. The circumference of a circle depends on its diameter, which is the distance across the circle through the center. The diameter is twice the radius, which is the distance from the center to the edge of the circle.

The circumference of a circle is related to the diameter and a special number called pi, which is approximately 3.14. Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of any circle, no matter how big or small. This means that if we divide the circumference of a circle by its diameter, we always get the same value, which is pi. We can write this as a formula:

Circumference = pi x diameter

To derive this identity, consider a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse of length 1 (unit circle), and let θ be one of the non-right angles. The side opposite to θ will have length sinθ, and the adjacent side will have length cosθ. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse.

68,FP16,Mathematics,Explain what continuity of a function means and give an example of a discontinuous function.,"


### Answer:Continuity of a function at a point means that the function is defined at that point, the limit of the function as it approaches that point exists, and the limit equals the function's value at that point. A function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every point in that interval.


An example of a discontinuous function is the step function, defined as:


f(x) = {

  1 for x >= 0,

  0 for x < 0

}


This function has a jump discontinuity at x = 0 because the limit of f(x) as x approaches 0 from the left does not equal the limit as x approaches 0 from the right, nor does it equal f(0).

70,FP16,Mathematics,How does integration relate to the area under a curve?,"

# Answer
Integration in calculus is a fundamental concept that relates to the area under a curve. When you integrate a function over a certain interval, you are essentially calculating the total area bounded by the curve of the function, the x-axis, and the vertical lines corresponding to the endpoints of the interval.

For a continuous function f(x) defined on an interval [a, b], the definite integral of f(x) from a to b is given by:

\[ \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \]

This integral represents the net area between the function f(x) and the x-axis from x = a to x = b. If the function is above the x-axis, the area is positive, and if the function is below the x-axis, the area is negative. The definite integral takes into account the direction of the area, so it can be thought of as the signed",16.0799,634.0416,39.43,,

**Solution 1:**

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers ""wrap around"" after they reach a certain value—the modulus. To understand this concept, consider a clock face. A standard clock has 12 hours, and when the hour hand moves from 12 to 1, it has completed one full cycle. If we think of the clock as a modular system with a modulus of 12, then the hour hand at 12 is equivalent to 0, at 1 is equivalent to 1, at 13 is equivalent to 1 (since 13 mod 12 is 1), and so on.


In modular arithmetic, we say that two numbers are congruent modulo a number n if they have the same remainder when divided by n. For example, 17 and 5 are congruent modulo 12",16.5845,647.8954,39.07,,

### Answer:
A vector is a mathematical entity that has both magnitude and direction, and it is typically represented by an arrow. The length of the arrow indicates the magnitude of the vector, while the direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the vector. Vectors are used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity, force, and displacement.

Scalars, on the other hand, are quantities that have only magnitude and no direction. Examples of scalar quantities include mass, temperature, and speed. Scalars are represented by a numerical value and a unit, but they do not have a direction associated with them.

In summary, the main difference between vectors and scalars is that vectors have both magnitude and direction, while scalars have only magnitude. Vectors are represented by arrows, while scalars are represented by numerical values and units.

### Answer:An asymptote is a line that a graph of a function approaches but never actually reaches. This concept is often encountered in the study of functions in calculus and precalculus. Asymptotes can be vertical, horizontal, or slanted (oblique).


Vertical asymptotes occur when the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as the input approaches a certain value. This typically happens when there is a division by zero in the function's formula. For example, the function f(x) = 1/(x-2) has a vertical asymptote at x = 2 because as x approaches 2, the function's value grows without bound.


Horizontal asymptotes are approached by the function as the input either goes to positive or negative infinity. They represent a value that the function gets closer and closer to but never actually reaches. For instance, the function f(x) = 3x + 1 has a horizontal",16.9815,664.5406,39.13,,

102,FP16,Science,What is cellular respiration and how does it differ from breathing?,"

# Answer
Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. It is a crucial process for the production of energy in both aerobic (requiring oxygen) and anaerobic (not requiring oxygen) conditions.

Breathing, on the other hand, is the physical process of inhaling oxygen from the environment and exhaling carbon dioxide produced by the body. It is a part of the respiratory system's function to facilitate gas exchange between the body and the environment.

The key differences between cellular respiration and breathing are:

### Answer:
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides, each of which is made up of three components: a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.


The structure of DNA is a double helix, which resembles a twisted ladder. The sugar and phosphate groups form the backbone of the DNA double helix, while the nitrogenous bases are the rungs. There are four types of nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G",16.3967,638.9539,38.97,,
104,FP16,Science,What is mitosis and why do cells need to divide?,"

# Answer
Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two genetically identical daughter cells from a single parent cell. It is essential for growth, repair, and maintenance in multicellular organisms. During mitosis, the cell's nucleus divides, ensuring that each new cell receives an exact copy of the parent cell's DNA.

Cells need to divide for several reasons:

1. **Growth**: As organisms grow, they need more cells to increase their size. Mitosis allows for the production of new cells to accommodate this growth.

2. **Repair and Regeneration**: When tissues are damaged due to injury or wear and tear, mitosis is responsible for replacing the lost or damaged cells, helping to heal and maintain the integrity of tissues and organs.

### Response:
Meiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in four genetically distinct daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the original cell. This process is essential for sexual reproduction and occurs in the germ cells to produce gametes (sperm and eggs).


Meiosis consists of two successive divisions: meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes (pairs of similar chromosomes, one from each parent) pair up and exchange genetic material through a process called crossing over. This leads to genetic recombination, which is a source of genetic diversity. The cells then divide, separating the homologous chromosomes.


In meiosis II, the sister chromatids (the duplicated chromosomes) are",16.8847,660.363,39.11,,
106,FP16,Science,What is natural selection and how does it lead to evolution over time?,"

# Answer
Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution described by Charles Darwin. It is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. The theory of natural selection states that individuals with traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction in their environment are more likely to pass on these beneficial traits to the next generation.

Over time, natural selection can lead to evolution, which is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Here's how the process works:

1. **Variation**: Within a population, individuals have variations in their traits, such as size, color, and behavior. These variations are often due to genetic differences, which can arise from mutations, gene shuffling during sexual reproduction, and other genetic mechanisms.

108,FP16,Science,What is the role of the cell membrane and what does 'selectively permeable' mean?,"

# Answer
The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the cell by acting as a barrier that separates the interior of the cell from the external environment. It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins, cholesterol, and carbohydrates that contribute to its structure and function.

The term 'selectively permeable' refers to the property of the cell membrane that allows it to control the movement of substances in and out of the cell. This means that the membrane permits some substances to pass through while restricting others. The selective permeability is essential for the cell to maintain homeostasis, which is the balance of conditions within the cell that are necessary for its survival and function.

The mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. They are often referred to as the ""powerhouse of the cell"" because they are responsible for producing the majority of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy.

Mitochondria have a unique structure that includes an outer membrane, an intermembrane space, an inner membrane, and a matrix. The inner membrane is folded into structures called cristae, which increase the surface area available for energy-generating chemical reactions.

Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. They consist of a nucleus made of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting this nucleus.

The nucleus, which contains the majority of an atom's mass, is at the center and is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons have a positive electrical charge, while neutrons have no charge (they are neutral). The number of protons in the nucleus determines the chemical element the atom represents (its atomic number).

### Solution 
A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms that allows the formation of chemical substances that contain two or more atoms. The bond is caused by the electromagnetic force between oppositely charged ions or between atoms sharing electrons.


Ionic bonds occur when one atom donates an electron to another atom, resulting in the formation of positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) that attract each other. This type of bond typically forms between metals and nonmetals. For example, sodium (Na) can donate an electron to chlorine (Cl), forming Na+ and Cl- ions that bond together to create sodium chloride (NaCl).

125,FP16,Science,Explain what happens during a chemical reaction and what the law of conservation of mass means.,"


### Answer:
During a chemical reaction, substances called reactants interact to form new substances called products. This process involves breaking chemical bonds in the reactants and forming new bonds to create the products. Chemical reactions can release or absorb energy, and they can occur in various forms, such as combustion, synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, and double replacement reactions.


The law of conservation of mass states that in a closed system, mass is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction. This means that the total mass of the reactants before the reaction must equal the total mass of the products after the reaction. This principle was established by Antoine Lavoisier in the 18th century and is fundamental to the science of chemistry. It implies that all atoms present in the reactants are simply rearranged to form the products, and no atoms are lost or gained in the process.

### Solution 
Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. When two atoms form a bond, the difference in their electronegativities determines the bond's polarity. If the electronegativity difference is significant (generally greater than 0.5 on the Pauling scale), the bond is considered polar, with the more electronegative atom acquiring a partial negative charge (δ-) and the less electronegative atom acquiring a partial positive charge (δ+). If the electronegativity difference is small or zero, the bond is nonpolar, with electrons shared more equally between the atoms.

This principle is used to predict the effect of a change in conditions on a chemical equilibrium.


For example, if the concentration of a reactant is increased, the system will respond by shifting the equilibrium position to favor the formation of products, thereby reducing the concentration of the added reactant. Conversely, if the concentration of a product is increased, the equilibrium will shift to favor the formation of reactants.


Similarly, changes in temperature and pressure can also affect the position of equilibrium. An increase in temperature will favor the endothermic direction of a reversible reaction, while a decrease in temperature will favor the exothermic direction.

140,FP16,Science,What is the difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions?,"

Exothermic reactions release energy in the form of heat or light, while endothermic reactions absorb energy from their surroundings.


In an exothermic reaction, the energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants is less than the energy released when new bonds form in the products. This excess energy is given off, often as heat, making the surroundings warmer. A common example of an exothermic reaction is the combustion of fuels, such as the burning of natural gas in a stove.


Conversely, in an endothermic reaction, the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is greater than the energy released when new bonds form in the products. This results in a net absorption of energy, which is typically taken in the form of heat, causing the surroundings to cool down. Photosynthesis in plants is",16.8053,655.1357,38.98,,

### Solution 1:

Newton's three laws of motion are fundamental principles that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. Here are the laws with everyday examples:


1. **Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia):** An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

   - **Example:** When you place a book on a table, it will remain at rest until you apply a force to move it. Similarly, a soccer ball on a field will not move until a player kicks it.


2. **Newton's Second Law (F=ma):** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

142,FP16,Science,What is the difference between speed and velocity?,"

# Answer
Speed and velocity are both measures of how fast an object is moving, but they are not the same thing. The key difference between the two lies in the fact that velocity is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction, while speed is a scalar quantity, which only has magnitude.

Speed is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time and is expressed in units such as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h). It tells us how fast an object is moving but does not specify the direction of the movement. For example, if a car is traveling at 60 km/h, that is its speed.

Velocity, on the other hand, is defined as the rate of change of an object's position with respect to time, including the direction of movement. It is also expressed in units of distance per time, such as meters per second (m/",16.0944,627.723,39.0,,

Momentum is a physical quantity that describes the motion of an object. It is defined as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. Mathematically, momentum (p) can be expressed as:

p = m * v

where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.

The law of conservation of momentum states that in a closed system, where no external forces are acting, the total momentum before an event (such as a collision) is equal to the total momentum after the event. This means that the momentum lost by one object is gained by another object, and the total momentum of the system remains constant.

For example, consider a collision between two billiard balls. Before the collision, the first ball has a momentum of 5 kg*m/s to the right, and the second ball has a momentum of 3 kg*m/s to the left. The total momentum of the system is",16.2577,637.7659,39.23,,

Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts two bodies with mass towards each other. It is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, alongside the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Gravity is the weakest of these forces, but it has an infinite range and it is the dominant force at the macroscopic scale, such as between planets, stars, and galaxies.

The gravitational force between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between their centers. This relationship is described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points.

### Answer:A wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium, transferring energy from one point to another without causing any permanent displacement of the medium itself. Waves can be classified into two main types based on the direction of the oscillation relative to the direction of the wave's travel: transverse waves and longitudinal waves.


In transverse waves, the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of the wave's travel. A common example of a transverse wave is a wave on a string or a water surface wave. The peaks and troughs of the wave move in a direction that is at right angles to the direction of energy transfer.


In contrast, longitudinal waves have oscillations that are parallel to the direction of the wave's travel. Sound waves in air are a typical example of longitudinal waves, where the particles of the medium (air) vibrate back and forth",16.7026,651.873,39.03,,

# Answer
The difference between series and parallel circuits lies in how the components are connected and how the current flows through them.

In a series circuit:
- Components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for the current to flow.
- The same current flows through all components.
- The total resistance of the circuit is the sum of the individual resistances.
- If one component fails, the entire circuit is interrupted, and current stops flowing.

151,FP16,Science,Explain what friction is and the difference between static and kinetic friction.,"

**Solution 1:**
Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It arises from the interactions at the microscopic level between the surfaces, which can include adhesion, surface roughness, and deformation.

Static friction occurs when two objects are not moving relative to each other. It is the force that must be overcome to start moving an object at rest. Static friction is generally higher than kinetic friction, meaning it takes more force to start the motion than to maintain it.

Kinetic friction, also known as dynamic friction, occurs when two objects are moving relative to each other. It is the force that opposes the motion of an object sliding over another. Kinetic friction is usually less than static friction, which is why it's easier to keep an object moving once it has started than it is to start the motion from rest.

### Solution 
Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different density. When light travels from air into water, it slows down because water is denser than air. This change in speed causes the light to change direction at the boundary between the two media. The straw appears bent in the glass of water because the light rays coming from the straw are refracted at the water's surface. To an observer, the light rays appear to be coming from a higher position than the actual straw, creating the illusion of a bent straw.

Reflection and refraction are two phenomena that occur when light interacts with different media. Reflection is the bouncing back of light from a surface, while refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another.

Reflection occurs when light rays hit a smooth and shiny surface, such as a mirror, a metal, or a calm water surface. The angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming light ray and the normal (a perpendicular line to the surface), is equal to the angle of reflection, which is the angle between the reflected light ray and the normal. This is known as the law of reflection. The reflected light rays form a virtual image of the object, which is the same size and shape as the object, but inverted.

155,FP16,Science,Explain what sound is and why it cannot travel through a vacuum.,"

Sound is a type of energy made by vibrations. When an object vibrates, it causes the air particles around it to move. These air particles bump into the particles next to them, which then bump into the particles next to them, and so on. This creates a wave of energy that moves through the air. This wave of energy is what we call sound.

Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because there are no air particles in a vacuum. Without air particles, there is nothing for the sound wave to move through. In other words, sound needs a medium (like air, water, or a solid material) to travel through. In a vacuum, there is no medium for the sound wave to move through, so sound cannot travel.

Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object that is thrown or projected into the air and is subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The two components of motion that act independently in projectile motion are:

1. Horizontal motion: This component is uniform, meaning that the horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the flight of the projectile, assuming there is no air resistance. The horizontal motion is not affected by gravity, which only acts in the vertical direction.

2. Vertical motion: This component is uniformly accelerated motion due to the force of gravity. The vertical velocity of the projectile changes at a constant rate, which is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s² downward). The vertical motion is independent of the horizontal motion, and the two components can be analyzed separately.

175,FP16,Science,Explain what eutrophication is and how excess fertilizer causes it.,"

Eutrophication is the process by which a body of water becomes overly enriched with nutrients, leading to excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants. This can result in a depletion of oxygen in the water, harming fish and other aquatic life.

Excess fertilizer can cause eutrophication when it runs off into nearby bodies of water. Fertilizers contain high levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for plant growth. When these nutrients enter a body of water, they can stimulate the growth of algae and other aquatic plants.

As these plants grow and die, they sink to the bottom of the water body, where they are decomposed by bacteria. This decomposition process consumes oxygen, leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen available for other aquatic organisms. This can",16.9767,664.9831,39.17,,

178,FP16,Science,What is the nitrogen cycle and why is nitrogen important for life?,"

Nitrogen is a chemical element that is essential for all living organisms, as it is a component of amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. However, most of the nitrogen on Earth is in the form of nitrogen gas (N2), which is inert and cannot be used directly by most organisms. Therefore, nitrogen has to undergo a series of transformations in the environment, called the nitrogen cycle, to become available for biological processes.

The nitrogen cycle consists of four main processes: nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, and ammonification. These processes involve different types of bacteria and other microorganisms that convert nitrogen between different chemical forms.

Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting nitrogen gas into ammonia (NH3) or ammon",16.72,649.21,38.83,,
179,FP16,Science,Explain what ocean acidification is and how it harms marine ecosystems.,"

Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. This process has significant implications for marine ecosystems, particularly for calcifying organisms such as corals, mollusks, and some plankton species.

When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. The increase in hydrogen ions leads to a decrease in pH, making the ocean more acidic. This process is known as ocean acidification.

Ocean acidification has several harmful effects on marine ecosystems:

Adaptation refers to the long-term genetic changes that occur in a population over many generations, allowing organisms to better survive and reproduce in their environment. These changes are heritable and can lead to the evolution of new species. Adaptations can involve changes in physical structures, behaviors, or physiological processes.

Acclimatization, on the other hand, refers to the short-term physiological adjustments that an individual organism makes in response to changes in its environment. These changes are reversible and do not involve genetic alterations. Acclimatization allows an organism to maintain homeostasis and function optimally in a new environment.

For example, when a person moves to a high-altitude area, their body may acclimatize by producing more red blood cells to compensate for the lower oxygen levels. This change is reversible and does not involve any genetic alterations.

182,FP16,Science,What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory in science?,"

# Answer
In science, a hypothesis and a theory have distinct meanings and roles in the scientific method.

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon or a prediction of a possible causal correlation among multiple phenomena. It is a starting point for investigation and is often based on limited evidence. A hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable, meaning that it can be supported or refuted through experimentation and observation.

A theory, on the other hand, is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed through observation and experimentation. Theories are broader in scope than hypotheses and are supported by a large and growing body of evidence. They provide a framework for understanding observations and predicting new phenomena.

# Answer
Peer review is a process used by journals and conferences to ensure the quality and integrity of scholarly research. It involves the evaluation of a researcher's work by other experts in the same field. The reviewers assess the validity, significance, and originality of the research, as well as its adherence to ethical standards and the clarity of its presentation.

Peer review is important in science for several reasons:

1. **Quality Control**: It acts as a filter to ensure that only high-quality research is published. Reviewers check for methodological soundness, the accuracy of data, and the logic of conclusions drawn.

2. **Credibility**: Research that has undergone peer review is more credible because it has been scrutinized by other knowledgeable individuals. This helps to build trust in scientific findings among the public and the scientific community.

### Answer:Correlation and causation are two fundamental concepts in statistics and research methodology.


Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, indicating that when one variable changes, the other variable tends to change in a specific direction (either positively or negatively). However, correlation does not imply that one variable causes the change in the other.


Causation, on the other hand, implies that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two variables.

190,FP16,Science,What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative data in an experiment?,"

# Answer
In an experiment, qualitative data refers to non-numerical information that describes qualities or characteristics. It is often collected through observations, interviews, or open-ended survey questions. Qualitative data can include descriptions of behaviors, experiences, or phenomena, and it is typically analyzed through thematic analysis or content analysis to identify patterns or themes.

Quantitative data, on the other hand, is numerical information that can be measured and quantified. It is collected through structured methods such as surveys with closed-ended questions, experiments with controlled variables, or measurements using instruments. Quantitative data can be subjected to statistical analysis to determine relationships, trends, or differences between groups.

In summary, qualitative data provides depth and context to understand the 'how' and 'why' behind certain behaviors or phenomena, while quantitative data offers the 'what' and 'how much' through measurable and count",16.5651,644.941,38.93,,

A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation. It is a possible answer to a question that is based on existing knowledge, evidence, or logic. A hypothesis usually takes the form of a statement that can be either supported or rejected by empirical data.

A prediction, on the other hand, is a specific statement about what will happen in a future experiment or observation based on a hypothesis or a theory. A prediction is usually expressed as a conditional statement that relates a cause and an effect. A prediction can be tested by conducting an experiment or making an observation that can confirm or falsify it.

For example, suppose you want to test the hypothesis that plants grow faster in sunlight than in darkness. A possible prediction based on this hypothesis is:

If plants are exposed to sunlight, then they will grow faster than plants that are kept in darkness.

**Solution 1:**
Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or state. For instance, when a rollercoaster car is at the top of a hill, it has a high amount of gravitational potential energy because of its elevated position relative to the ground. This energy is a result of the work done to lift the car to that height against the force of gravity.

Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is the energy of motion. As the rollercoaster car begins to descend the hill, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the car to accelerate. The faster the car moves, the more kinetic energy it has. At the bottom of the hill, the car has its maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy.

Vaccines are biological preparations that provide active acquired immunity to a particular infectious disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.

### Answer:
A conductor is a material that allows the flow of electric charge (usually electrons) with relative ease. Conductors have free electrons that can move throughout the material, which makes them capable of conducting electricity. Examples of conductors include metals such as copper, aluminum, gold, and silver.


An insulator, on the other hand, is a material that resists the flow of electric charge. Insulators have tightly bound electrons that are not free to move around, which prevents the flow of electricity. Examples of insulators include rubber, glass, plastic, and dry wood.
